# Hangman

Made using Python and Tkinter (GUI) and by following techniques taught in a Udemy Tkiner course.
Used the Object Oriented technique by creating a class that inherits from Tkk.


The game is the classic Hangman game. Everytime the user enters an incorrect letter, the letter is displayed on the right of the window and the image of the man changes. 
When a correct input is entered the letter is displaced instead of _ placeholders.

The project also uses the Pillow library for opening and displaying the images. 

The Images used look like seen below (stored in assets directory)
